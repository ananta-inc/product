This repository contains a portfolio of projects that I have worked on in groups regarding the development of a system and the identification of information resources from a company.  
The first document is a system requirements analysis document which contains how we analyze the current system of the company and develop it into a proposed system that is able to better automate the company's business processes.  
The second document is an IT resource management document which contains how we analyze a company's ability to run IT processes and analyze how the company should develop its resources to be able to better accommodate IT processes.
